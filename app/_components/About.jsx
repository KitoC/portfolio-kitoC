      and discovered a hidden passion (and at times unhealthy addiction) from
      the first line of code I wrote. This journey has provided me with the
      skills and privelage of building software in a range of companies and
      industries including{" "}

      <br />I enjoy blending creativity with logic in my quest to solve real
      world problems in the cyber universe. I am a firm believer in fostering a
      collaborative environment, where knowledge sharing and mutual growth are
      key to enhancing the efficiency and performance of the teams I work with.

      <br />
      In my personal time I enjoy travel, surfing and Muay Thai. I also have a
      newfound passion for woodworking, and in specific building wooden
      surfboards.
