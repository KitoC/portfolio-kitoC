      As a senior software developer, my primary focus is on building resilient
      and maintainable software solutions. I blend creativity with logical
      problem-solving to develop innovative solutions. I am a firm believer in
      fostering a collaborative environment, where knowledge sharing and mutual
      growth are key to enhancing the efficiency and performance of the teams I
      work with. <br />

      In my personal time I enjoy travel, surfing and Muay Thai. I also have a
      newfound passion for woodworking, and in specific building wooden
      surfboards.
